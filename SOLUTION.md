The application is a simple Python Flask web service with the following endpoints:
- `GET /`: Returns a success message
- `GET /health`: Returns JSON `{"status": "ok"}`

## Design Choices
<!-- Document your architectural decisions here -->

### Tools and Resources used
<!-- List any tools used such as AI, reference implementations, official documentation -->

## Trade-offs and Considerations
<!-- Discuss any trade-offs you made in your implementation -->

## Production Readiness and Future Improvements
<!-- If you had more time, what things would need to be modified to make this appropriate for production -->
